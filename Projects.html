            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    This is a first draft of a personal website I started when I was first learning HTML/CSS. Eventually I would like to transition this website into something
                    based around React or Vue. This is mainly here at the start to show my progess as I learn more frontend development.<br>
                    In this project I used:
                    <ul id = "skills">
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Anime Quiz</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    This was a simple quiz app that I created practicing basic jquery. It is still running without any kind of frontend library however I started to add onto
                    just vanilla HTML and CSS by creating a way to change what was being displayed on the screen. The questions were very basic, however this was the first time
                    I started to experiment by adding JavaScript into my code.<br>
                    In this project I used:

            <h2>React Project</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    This is the first project that I started to implement React with. It is used to customize a laptop that you could buy online. It only offers a couple
                    options per part, however the overall goal was to get it so that the choice for each part would highlight as well as update the cart on the left hand side<br>
                    In this project I used:
                    <ul id = "skills">

            <h2>Noteful Project</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    In this project I created an app that ran off a server using API calls to add folders, notes and other various ways to organize ideas/thoughts. It was a 
                    simple project working off an already created API, however since then I have also had experience with backend work creating custom API calls.<br>
