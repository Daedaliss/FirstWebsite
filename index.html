            <p>
              I am an aspiring Website Developer located in Madison, Wisconsin. 
              I came to realize my love for coding while going to the University of Wisconsin - Madison when I was first introduced to Python and have loved it ever since. I have exposure with:

            <h3> About Will </h3>
            <p>
            After attending school at the University of Wisconsin - Madison I found a great passion for coding. In my free time though, I get a kick out of playing videogames with friends, as well as getting a pick up game of soccer or football together. When not with a larger group of friends I also enjoy exploring the state parks of Wisconsin and playing board games.
