                I am an aspiring Web Developer located in Madison, Wisconsin. 
                I came to realize my love for coding while going to the University of Wisconsin - Madison when I was first introduced to Python and have loved it ever since. 
                As a web developer I am looking to provide my knowledge of coding to work and provide the best services I can to get the job done.
                I have exposure with:

                <p>
                After attending school at the University of Wisconsin - Madison I found a great passion for coding. In my free time though, I get a kick out of playing videogames
                 with friends, as well as getting a pick up game of soccer or football together. When in a smaller group of people I enjoy playing video games or even board games.
                 I also enjoy going out and capturing the beauty of nature.
